					<h3>Dr. Fe del Mundo</h3>
					<p>Invented the <strong>bamboo incubator</strong> in 1941, which was to be easy to reproduce and more accessible
					to those who lived in rural communities or in areas with no electricity. She became the first woman to become a 
					National Scientist in the Philippines in 1980.</p>
					
					<h3>Dr. Abelardo Aguilar</h3>
					<p>Discovered a new form of bacteria in his backyard in 1949. This led to the discovery of 
					<strong>Erythromycin</strong>, an antibiotic used to treat respiratiory infections, Legionnaires disease, 
					diphtheria, UTIs, and STIs such as syphilis.</p>
					
					<h3>Diosdado Banatao</h3>
					<p>Developed the first single-chip 16-bit microprocessor-based calculator in the 1970s. Then went on to
					create the worldâ€™s first <strong>PC chipsets</strong> in 1981, which integrated all essential data processing
					features of a computer into one small package.</p>
