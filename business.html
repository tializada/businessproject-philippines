				<li>Half of the country's total area is forested.</li>
				<li>Metal deposits are estimated at 21.5 billion metric tons.</li>
				<li>Non-metal deposits are projected at 19.3 billion metric tons.</li>

			<h3>Top 3 Products</h3>
			<p class="adv"><strong>1. Construction Materials (Competitive):</strong> The country has an abundance of natural resources.</p>
			
			<p class="adv"><strong>2. Electronics (Competitive):</strong> Most of the population consists of a highly educated workforce,
			giving them the innovation needed to produce high quality products.</p>
			
			<p class="adv"><strong>3. Agriculture (Absolute):</strong> Combined with the abundance of natural resources, the fertile soil

			<h3>Competitive Edge</h3>
				<p class="adv">The Philippines has a competitive advantage when it comes to a quality workforce. 
				With a priority in education, the country’s literacy rate is <em>94.6%.</em> Since English is also taught 
				in all schools, this makes the Philippines the world’s 3rd largest English-speaking country. The
				employment rate in October 2019 is estimated at <em>95.5%.</em></p>
 
				<p class="adv">Located in the heart of Asia, it is four hours of flying time away from the major 
				capitals of the region. It is an entry point to over 500 million people in the <strong>ASEAN</strong> market and 
				a way for many European and American businesses to do international shipping.</p>
				
				<br><hr><br>
				
			<h3>Opportunities for Canadian Businesses</h3>

			<br><h3>Trade Agreements with Canada</h3><br>
		
			<p class="adv"><strong><em>Bilateral Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments</em></strong></p>
			<p class="adv">Currently in force since November 13, 1996. In this treaty, both countries have 
		discussed and agreed on the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establishment, Acquisition and Protection of Investment</li>
				<li>National Treatment after Establishment and Exceptions to National Treatment</li>
				<li>Compensation for Losses</li>
				<li>Expropriation (Dispossession of property)</li>

			<p class="adv"><strong><em>Free Trade agreement between Canada and the ASEAN</em></strong></p>
			<p class="adv">This agreement is currently still up for discussion. It was announced on September 10, 2019 
			in Bangkok, Thailand. The agreement would be beneficial to Canada as the ASEAN member states together would 
			represent the 5th largest economy in the world, but also the country’s 6th largest trading partner. Because 
			Canada is also one of the 10 dialogue partners of ASEAN, it is highly likely that both sides want to expand
			their economies together through this agreement with the relations they have.</p><br>

		<br><h3>Trade Organizations</h3><br>
		<p class="adv"><strong><em>APEC - Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</em></strong></p>
		
		<p class="adv">APEC was established in 1989 to respond to the growing interdependence among the Asia-Pacific 
		economies. Canada and the Philippines are one of the founding members, along with: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, 
		Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. The countries 
		that joined after its establishment were: China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chile, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia, 
		Vietnam, and New Zealand.</p><br>
		
		<p class="adv">The Philippines’ relationship with the APEC makes it important for trade as imports and exports summed 
		up around 84% of their totals. Being a part of APEC also granted the country many benefits, such as: an increase in trade, 
		lower tariffs, decrease in cost and time to start a business, reduce costs for importers and exporters in the region.</p><br>
		
		<p class="adv"><strong><em>Impact on Canada</em></strong></p>
		<p class="adv">ASEAN and APEC are one of Canada’s largest trading partners, with APEC accounting for more than 84% of its 
		total trade, and ASEAN being its 6th largest trading partner in the world. Four out of the top five of Canada’s trading 
		partners are also APEC members, which are the United States, Japan, Mexico, and China. Being a part of this organization
		would strengthen ties between these countries, as well as strengthen them with the Philippines, where they share similar 
		interests. In addition, Canada is also looking for discussion of an FTA (Free Trade Agreement) with the ASEAN, securing 
		that relationship with the Philippines because of their affiliation with the same organizations.</p><br>

		<br><h3>Partnership with Canada</h3><br>
		<p class="adv"><strong><em>Ethical Labour Recuitment</em></strong></p>
		<p class="adv">Between the Philippines and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the UN Migration Agency 
		signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to facilitate the ethical recruitment of Filipino workers on June 8, 2019. 
		The Commissions of Filipinos Overseas (CFO) estimates that there are over 700 000 Filipinos living in Canada.</p><br>
