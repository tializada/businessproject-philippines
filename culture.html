	<h2>Global Ethics & Social Responsibility</h2>
	
	<h3>Environment</h3>
	
	<p>As of recent, the Taal volcano erupted on January 12th, sending ash into the 
	sky and lava onto the waters. It is located 70km south of Manila, the capital, 
	which could threaten the city as earthquakes resulted from the eruption. It is 
	expected that the volcano will continue to be active for the next few days. In 
	addition, Taal sits on a large lake, which has a high possibly that the eruption 
	can create a dangerous tsunami to towns and cities in the surrounding area.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Human Rights</h3>
	
	<p>President Duterte faces international criticism since he took office in 2016. 
	The drug war he initiated caused the deaths of over 12 000 people. Homicide rates 
	have also increased since the war began, as well as the attacks of journalists and 
	news outlets that criticized his actions, violating the freedom of the press.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Corruption</h3>
	
	<p>There is a belief of widespread corruption in the Philippines that may hinder 
	business in the country. Although it does run rampant with Duterte’s “war on drugs” 
	campaign, Filipinos in general are moral and honest, where these values are commonly 
	practiced.</p>
