			<h2>Trade Relations with Canada</h2>
			<br>
				<p class="trade_relations">​Diplomatic relations between Canada and the Philippines have been going on since 1949 
				after the end of World War 2. Cooperation between both countries are close, strong and
				friendly to promote democratic development, peace, and to protect human rights. Aside from 
				the waste dispute that occurred back in May, Canada's reputation in the Philippines has been 
				relatively high; Canadian products and services were known to be of high quality in the country.</p>
 
				<p class="trade_relations">Canada, the Philippines, and the rest of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) have
				announced discussions of an FTA (Free Trade Agreement) on September 10th, in Bangkok Thailand. 
				If the agreement goes through, it will prove to be beneficial for both countries.</p><br>
